        "description": "This project was designed for children ages 8+ with the goal of making math fun and engaging. It was built from scratch without any frameworks, libraries or dependencies using OOP and SOC principles, and with the intention of making code DRY and easier to maintain. Utilizes heavy JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Uses promises instead of while loops to track progress. Visual design is based on retro arcade Shoot-em Up games. Good luck surviving the hardest difficulty!",

            "Gameplay works completely but there are some minor bugs to fix, mainly in the areas of UI/UX. Very rarely, game does not load when difficulty is selected. Simply refresh the browser and try again.",
            "Some features are missing such as player entered details, data persistence, settings; to be implemented at a later date.",
            "Use Google Chrome for the best experience. Not yet fully responsive on smaller devices!"
