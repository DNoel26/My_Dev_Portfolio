It was built from scratch without any frameworks, libraries or dependencies using OOP and SOC principles, and with the intention of making code DRY and easier to maintain. Utilizes heavy JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Uses promises instead of while loops to track progress. Visual design is based on retro arcade Shoot-em Up games. Good luck surviving the hardest difficulty!",

There are both customer and employee functionalities to experiment with. Features such as authorization, authentication, page protection, session storage, pagination, multiple queries per database call, database transactions, product tracking, product restocking, add to cart, payment processing using a modified PayPal SDK, to name a few, were all built from the ground up and implemented in this site.
