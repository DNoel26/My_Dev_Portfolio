## Tools & Technologies
My porftolio was designed and built from scratch using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. It may be a single page but a lot of thought went into it and
also a lot of functionality has been included. It incorporates things like API consumption, Separation of Concerns, Throttling and Debouncing, AJAX, etc.
